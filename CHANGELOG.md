# Changelog

All notable changes to Hitoku Draft are documented in this file.

## [1.0.7] — 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Context-aware screen capture**: captures the active window's visible text before generating edits, giving the LLM richer context for smarter, more relevant output.
- Screen recording permission request and settings toggle.
- Localized strings for screen-capture feature (en, es, fr, it).

### Changed
- Edit and draft prompts now incorporate captured screen context when available.

## [1.0.6] — 2026-03-15

Version bump and Sparkle distribution update — no user-facing changes.

## [1.0.5] — 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Ghost HUD style**: new overlay variant with heavy blur and wallpaper bleed-through, now the default dictation overlay.

### Changed
- Refined dictation overlay panel positioning and layout.

## [1.0.4] — 2026-03-13

### Added
- Cached model weight cleanup: removing a custom HuggingFace model now deletes its downloaded weights from `~/Library/Caches`.
- Previous-model restore: deleting the active custom model falls back to the previously-used model instead of the smart default.

### Changed
- Improved release script with version-jump sanity checks and backwards-version warnings.

## [1.0.3] — 2026-03-13

### Added
- Release automation script (`release.sh`) for build, sign, notarize, and Sparkle appcast generation.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Microphone sharing**: added retry delay so the mic can settle when another app (Zoom, Voice Memos) reconfigures the audio hardware; new "mic in use" error distinct from "no mic found."
- Model switching now cancels any in-progress setup/download before starting the new one.

### Changed
- Updated to latest MLXAudioSTT API (`STTGenerateParameters()` initializer).
- Sparkle auto-update integration and codesign workaround for non-App-Store distribution.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-12

### Added
- Persistent custom model registry with JSON config at `~/.config/hitokudraft/models.json`.
- MLX Audio STT service integration for on-device speech-to-text.
- Menu bar icon and macOS menu bar app structure.
- Localization resources (English, Spanish, French, Italian).
- Settings UI with model download progress.
- ConversationCoordinator orchestration pipeline.
